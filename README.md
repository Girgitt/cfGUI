# cfGUI
A simple GUI library for M5Stack (ESP32)

This library is intended to run on M5Stack development board (http://www.m5stack.com/). However, it should be easy to port it to any other board.

The following widgets have been created so far:
  - Screen
  - Bar
  - StatusBar (with uptime, current time and wifi signal)
  - Button
  - Mosaic of widge
  
# Todo
